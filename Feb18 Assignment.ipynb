    "These technologies fail because they rely on binary messaging. The XML messaging that SOAP employs works better over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP\n",
    "1.Resource-consuming: Due to the larger size of an XML-file and a payload created by the massive structure of a message, a SOAP API requires a \n",
    "  larger bandwidth. \n",
    "2.Hard learning curve: Being protocol-based, building SOAP API servers requires knowledge and understanding of all protocols you may use with it.\n",
